# Introduction

--> Queue is a type of Linear Data Structure in which an element is inserted from one End called REAR and Deleted from other end called FRONT
--> Follows FIFO Rule (First in First Out)

# What is FIFO (First In First Out) order?

Let us try to get the meaning of FIFO using an example. Consider a "queue" of people standing at an Aadhar Verification Center:
The first person who had joined the queue was the old lady with the stick. And the last person who joined the queue was a girl with a yellow document. Now, the old lady will get her aadhaar verified first, then the businessman, .. and at last the lady with the yellow document.

So, we can say that the first person who first joined the queue was served first, and the last person joining the queue will be served last ( it is nothing but first come first serve). This ordering of elements is known as FIFO (First In First Out).

# Operations

There are Many Operations defined with Queue Data Structures

1. Enqueue() / add()
2. Dequeue() / remove()
3. isEmpty()
4. isFull()
5. Display()
6. size()
7. peek() / front()

# Applications

1. Queue can be used for various CPU scheduling algorithms like First Come First Serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm, etc.
2. Queue is used in networking fields like in routers/switches, mail queues, etc.
3. Queue data structure is used for BFS tree traversals.
